## 🏛️ Philosophy

> The river flows, knowledge drifts, emergence patterns.

This is not a slogan. It is the operating system running through every line of code, every search, every analysis.

### 📜 Three Tenets

**🌊 The River Flows** — Packages update, species migrate, consensus shifts, climate reshapes. Today's certainty is tomorrow's footnote. We place knowledge on a timeline and view it dynamically.

**🍂 Knowledge Drifts** — The foundation of science is falsifiability (Popper). No discovery is final — only the best current explanation. We speak in calibrated language: evidence suggests, not proves.

**🌟 Emergence Patterns** — Life, consciousness, ecosystems, AI reasoning — all emergent. When three or more independent sources converge on the same unexpected pattern, the system flags emergence — never dismisses it as noise.

### ⚖️ Why This Matters

| Scenario | Traditional | Dynamic Worldview |
|:---------|:-----------|:-------------------|
| Citations | Studies prove | Smith (2022) found X; Jones (2024) added Y |
| Outliers | Dismiss as noise | Three or more sources → emergence signal |
| Knowledge Decay | Handbook frozen | Review records include next review date |
| Method | Fixed pipeline | Dynamic selection, dynamic confidence |

> 道生一，一生二，二生三，三生万物。

From One comes Two, from Two comes Three, from Three come all things.

## 🔗 Ecosystem

This project is the Coordination Hub (Coord) in the SanShengWanWu ecosystem.

```
Triangle Core (sealed 3):
  📦 fish-ecology-assistant    → Knowledge Supply (V0)
  🔍 cognitive-search-engine   → Search Verification (V1)
  ⚙️ eon-core                  → Coordination Hub (Coord)

Derived Projects (open N):
  🐬 porpoise-agent    → P₁ Porpoise Expert
  🐟 coilia-agent      → P₂ Coilia Expert
  🐟 culter-agent      → P₃ Culter Expert
  🔥 conflict-arbiter  → C  Conflict Arbitration
```

> 🔥 Together infinite power, apart top expert engines.

This project is not a fixed toolset — it is a **living system**. Every component has built-in expiration mechanisms, version tracking, and emergence awareness. As your research deepens, packages update, and new methods emerge, it evolves with you.
